### APP IDEA
- POMODORO APP
- LOCKS PHONE, ONLY LETS YOU OPEN IN EMERGENCY (3 USES)
- REWARD SYSTEM, STREAKS, ETC


I envision a highly productive Pomodoro app designed to enhance focus and time management. This app incorporates a unique feature that allows users to lock their phones during focused work sessions, limiting access to emergency use only (with a maximum of 3 emergency uses per session). The app employs the popular Pomodoro technique, breaking work into intervals with short breaks in between. Users can customize the length of work sessions and breaks. To further motivate users, the app implements a reward system, granting achievements for completing consecutive Pomodoro sessions, creating streaks, and achieving productivity milestones. Additionally, the app could include analytics to track productivity trends over time, providing insights to improve time management habits. The emergency use limitation aims to instill discipline and prevent distractions, fostering a more focused and efficient work environment.
